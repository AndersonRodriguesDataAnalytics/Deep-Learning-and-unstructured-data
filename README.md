# Phase 5 - Multilayer Perceptron

Nature has inspired many innovations for human beings. Just as birds inspired the creation of airplanes and the burdock plant led to the invention of Velcro, the functioning of the human brain served as the basis for artificial neural networks (ANN). These networks, which are part of deep learning, are highly scalable and powerful, being widely used to solve complex challenges in the field of machine learning. Among their applications are image classification, speech recognition, image creation, advanced chat systems, and even learning electronic games.

In this phase, you will learn how neural networks work, focusing on the architecture of multilayer networks (Multilayer Perceptron - MLP). In addition to understanding the theory behind these networks, you will implement them in practice using Python and the Keras library.

## Neural Networks and the Keras Library

The Keras library is widely used in real applications, present in services such as YouTube, Netflix, Uber, Yelp, Instacart, Zocdoc, Twitter, and Square/Block. According to the "State of Data Science and Machine Learning" survey of 2022 conducted by Kaggle, Keras had an adherence rate of 61% among data scientists. This shows the popularity and importance of this tool in the area of machine learning.

Let's go for a hands-on implementation of a multilayer perceptron model!

## Characteristics of the Multilayer Perceptron

- The model has a binary nature (0 and 1), where both the input signals and the output are binary values.
- Acts as a linear (binary) classifier.
- The weights of the neural network are adjustable and can be excitatory or inhibitory (positive or negative values), inspired by the functioning of brain synapses.
- Used in supervised learning and can classify supplied input data.
- The classification of the inputs separates two categories with a straight line.

## Code Inspiration

The base code for this project was taken from the FIAP repository:

Let's explore deep learning and develop a multilayer perceptron model with Keras.
